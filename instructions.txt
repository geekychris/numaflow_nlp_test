create me an app that uses numaflow.  This app should consume events from a kafka topic.  These events will contain json documents with a number of fields including a title and a description.  The applicaiton should enrich these records by taking any text field and computing the segmented text, that is text split by sentences.  Further the sentence segmented text should have any named entites computed for them too and stored as part of the enriched record.  For any tools used in enrichment their models should run locally.  Make sure that the app is easy to test and debug locally.  It should include design and build instructions along with any scripts and resources to run in docker and kubernetes.  This application can be written in java spring.  Include tests.  There is already a locally running kafka that is running in kubernetes.
